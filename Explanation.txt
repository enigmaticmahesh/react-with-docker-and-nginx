1. We haven't used docker compose in this case
2. I have used "docker build -t mahesh/docker_react_test ." command to build image
    a) "-t" flag is used to make tags
    b) in my case it is <username>/<tag_name>
    c) usernmae is generally for creating acc in "dockerhub", so that the image can be push/pull by users
    d) "." is used as of the respective place of "Dockerfile"
3. To make container, I used " docker run -p 3000:80 bbaef5faf80d ", which will run the docker image
    a) I have exposed port 3000 for the react app in the "Dockerfile", but it won't be accessible
    b) For that to work, we can map our system port with the docker exposed port called port forwarding
    c) This can be done using "-p" flag, where the syntax is <local>:<container>
    d) even if we have exposed port 3000 in the container, it is "80", bcoz, nginx default port is "80"
    e) if we wouldn't have built the react app, rather only served it using "npm start", then it would have "3000:3000"
4. We have used "dockerignore" file so that it would not copy the "node_modules" when the "COPY . ." command runs by Docker, in "Dockerfile"
